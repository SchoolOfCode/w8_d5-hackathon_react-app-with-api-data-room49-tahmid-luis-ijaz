WikiHeroes - A plpace to search and learn about your favourite Heroes! 

Step 1:
Link the API to our project, and then create the components. 

Step 2: 
Deploy the project on netify

Step 3: 
Build the components 

Step 4: 
Build 3 individual pages and a homepage

Steps 5: Figure out how to use one api to call the data on various routes rather then hard coding the api in each respective site. 
(an idea would be to use the link as a trigger to call the api or have a button on each site that calls data like name, where they're from etc)

Step 6: Optimizing the build to use one api:
Create a home page with a search feature to look for a hero. 
On the home page call all the data and then work from there.
